	abstract = {In this paper we provide an approach to perform seamless continual biometric authentication of users in virtual reality (VR) environments by combining position and orientation features from the headset, right hand controller, and left hand controller of a VR system. The rapid growth of VR in mission critical applications in military training, flight simulation, therapy, manufacturing, and education necessitates authentication of users based on their actions within the VR space as opposed to traditional PIN and password based approaches. To mimic goal-oriented interactions as they may occur in VR environments, we capture a VR dataset of trajectories from 33 users throwing a ball at a virtual target with 10 samples per user captured on a training day, and 10 samples on a test day. Due to the sparseness in the number of training samples per user, typical of realistic interactions, we perform authentication by using pairwise relationships between trajectories. Our approach uses a perceptron classifier to learn weights on the matches between position and orientation features on two trajectories from the headset and the hand controllers, such that a low classifier score is obtained for trajectories belonging to the same user, and a high score is obtained otherwise. We also perform extensive evaluation on the choice of position and orientation features, combination of devices, and choice of match metrics and trajectory alignment method on the accuracy, and demonstrate a maximum accuracy of 93.03},

	abstract = {To enhance presence, facilitate sensory motor performance, and avoid disorientation or nausea, virtual-reality applications require the perception of a stable environment. End-end tracking latency (display lag) degrades this illusion of stability and has been identified as a major fault of existing virtual-environment systems. Oscillopsia refers to the perception that the visual world appears to swim about or oscillate in space and is a manifestation of this loss of perceptual stability of the environment. The effects of end-end latency and head velocity on perceptual stability in a virtual environment were investigated psychophysically. Subjects became significantly more likely to report oscillopsia during head movements when end-end latency or head velocity were increased. It is concluded that perceptual instability of the world arises with increased head motion and increased display lag. Oscillopsia is expected to be more apparent in tasks requiring real locomotion or rapid head movement.},

@techreport{Badillo:2006,
	abstract = {When designing for large screen displays, designers are forced to deal with cursor tracking issues, interacting over distances, and space management issues. Because of the large visual angle of the user that the screen can cover, it may be hard for users to begin and complete search tasks for basic items such as cursors or icons. In addition, maneuvering over long distances and acquiring small targets understandably takes more time than the same interactions on normally sized screen systems. To deal with these issues, large display researchers have developed more and more unconventional devices, methods and widgets for interaction, and systems for space and task management. For tracking cursors there are techniques that deal with the size and shape of the cursor, as well as the ``density'' of the cursor. There are other techniques that help direct the attention of the user to the cursor. For target acquisition on large screens, many researchers saw fit to try to augment existing 2D GUI metaphors. They try to optimize Fitts' law to accomplish this. Some techniques sought to enlarge targets while others sought to enlarge the cursor itself. Even other techniques developed ways of closing the distances on large screen displays. However, many researchers feel that existing 2D metaphors do not and will not work for large screens. They feel that the community should move to more unconventional devices and metaphors. These unconventional means include use of eye-tracking, laser-pointing, hand-tracking, two-handed touchscreen techniques, and other high-DOF devices. In the end, many of these developed techniques do provide effective means for interaction on large displays. However, we need to quantify the benefits of these methods and understand them better. The more we understand the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques, the easier it will be to employ them in working large screen systems. We also need to put into place a kind of interaction standard for these large screen systems. This could mean simply supporting desktop events such as pointing and clicking. It may also mean that we need to identify the needs of each domain that large screens are used for and tailor the interaction techniques for the domain.},

	abstract = {Finallya thorough pedagogical survey of the multidisciplinary science of HCI. Human-Computer Interaction spans many disciplines, from the social and behavioral sciences to information and computer technology. But of all the textbooks on HCI technology and applications, none has adequately addressed HCI's multidisciplinary foundationsuntil now. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks fills a huge void in the education and training of advanced HCI students. Its authors comprise a veritable house of diamondsinternationally known HCI researchers, every one of whom has successfully applied a unique scientific method to solve practical problems. Each chapter focuses on a different scientific analysis or approach, but all in an identical format, especially designed to facilitate comparison of the various models. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks answers the question raised by the other HCI textbooks: How can HCI theory can support practice in HCI? * Traces HCI research from its origins * Surveys 14 different successful research approaches in HCI * Presents each approach in a common format to facilitate comparisons * Web-enhanced with teaching tools at http://www.HCImodels.com *Contributors are leading researchers in the field of Human-Comptuter Interaction *Fills a major gap in current literature about the rich scientific foundations of HCI *Provides a thorough pedogological survey of the science of HCI},

@article{Bock:1992fk,
	abstract = {Human subjects pointed, without sight of their arm, at visual targets presented on a mirror-viewed monitor screen. During the adaptation period of each experiment, the position of the pointing fingertip was continuously recorded and displayed on the screen along with the targets. This visual feedback was not always veridical; rather, it was manipulated to require a gradual modification of the pointing response gain throughout the adaptation period. No visual feedback at all was available during the pre- and postadaptation periods of each experiment. The adaptive effect was determined as difference between pre- and postadaptation gains. In Expt. A, visual feedback during the adaptation period prescribed a gradual reduction of the horizontal response gain without specifying the gain for other directions; the adaptive effect was found to generalize uniformly to all movement directions. Expt. B1 prescribed a reduction of the horizontal, and an unchanged vertical gain component: in spite of this differential requirement, the adaptive effect was again uniform for all directions. Expt. B2 prescribed a reduction of horizontal, and an increase of the vertical gain component: we found a reduced gain for all directions, with a mild direction-dependence in the magnitude of the adaptive effect. In a modified version of Expt. B2, no intermanual transfer of the adaptive effect was found. Expt. C1-3 prescribed gain reduction for target directions with 15, 30, or 45{$\infty$} around the horizontal, and gain increase for all other directions: we found little or no adaptive effects under such conditions. From the above findings, we concluded that the adapted system controls movement gain largely independent of movement direction. This mechanism responds readily to requirements for gain reduction, but not gain increase. No evidence for an organization of the arm motor system in direction-selective channels was found, in contrast to findings on the saccadic control system in a paradigm similar to our Expt. A8. This discrepancy supports the view that arm and eye movements are controlled by distinct mechanisms.},

@article{Cao:2021ue,
	abstract = {Dynamic field of view (FOV) restrictors have been successfully used to reduce visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) during continuous viewpoint motion control (virtual travel) in virtual reality (VR). This benefit, however, comes at the cost of losing peripheral awareness during provocative motion. Likewise, the use of visual references that are stable in relation to the physical environment, called rest frames (RFs), has also been shown to reduce discomfort during virtual travel tasks in VR. We propose a new RF-based design called Granulated Rest Frames (GRFs) with a soft-edged circular cutout in the center that leverages the rest frames' benefits without completely blocking the user's peripheral view. The GRF design is application-agnostic and does not rely on context-specific RFs, such as commonly used cockpits. We report on a within-subjects experiment with 20 participants. The results suggest that, by strategically applying GRFs during a visual search session in VR, we can achieve better item searching efficiency as compared to restricted FOV. The effect of GRFs on reducing VIMS remains to be determined by future work.},

	abstract = {Visually-induced motion sickness (VIMS), a side effect of perceived motion caused by visual stimulation, is a major obstacle to the widespread use of Virtual Reality (VR). Along with scene object information, visual stimulation can be primarily indicated by optical flow, which characterizes the motion pattern, such as the intensity and direction of the moving image. We estimated the real time optical flow in 360-degree videos targeted at immersive user interactive visualization based on the user's current viewport. The proposed method allows the estimation of customized visual flow for each experience of dynamic 360-degree videos and is an improvement over previous methods that consider a single optical flow value for the entire equirectangular frame. We applied our method to modulate the opacity of granulated rest frames (GRFs), a technique consisting of visual noise-like randomly distributed visual references that are stable to the user's body during immersive pre-recorded 360-degree video experience. We report the results of a pilot one-session between-subject study with 18 participants, where users watched a 2-minute high-intensity 360-degree video. The results show that our proposed method successfully estimates optical flow, with pilot data showing that GRFs combined with real-time optical flow estimation may improve user comfort when watching 360-degree videos. However, more data are needed for statistically significant results.},

	abstract = {We studied pursuit eye movements in seven normal human subjects with the scleral search-coil technique. The initial eye movements in response to unpredictable changes in target motion were analyzed to determine the effect of target velocity and position on the latency and acceleration of the response. By restricting our analysis to the presaccadic portion of the response we were able to eliminate any saccadic interactions, and the randomized stimulus presentation minimized anticipatory responses. This approach has allowed us to characterize a part of the smooth-pursuit system that is dependent primarily on retinal image properties. The latency of the smooth-pursuit response was very consistent, with a mean of 100 +/- 5 ms to targets moving 5 degrees/s or faster. The responses were the same whether the velocity step was presented when the target was initially stationary or after tracking was established. The latency did increase for lower velocity targets; this increase was well described by a latency model requiring a minimum target movement of 0.028 degrees, in addition to a fixed processing time of 98 ms. The presaccadic accelerations were fairly low, and increased with target velocity until an acceleration of about 50 degrees/s2 was reached for target velocities of 10 degrees/s. Higher velocities produced only a slight increase in eye acceleration. When the target motion was adjusted so that the retinal image slip occurred at increasing distances from the fovea, the accelerations declined until no presaccadic response was measurable when the image slip started 15 degrees from the fovea. The smooth-pursuit response to a step of target position was a brief acceleration; this response occurred even when an oppositely directed velocity stimulus was present. The latency of the pursuit response to such a step was also approximately 100 ms. This result seems consistent with the idea that sensory pathways act as a low-pass spatiotemporal filter of the retinal input, effectively converting position steps into briefly moving stimuli. There was a large asymmetry in the responses to position steps: the accelerations were much greater when the position step of the target was away from the direction of tracking, compared with steps in the direction of tracking. The asymmetry may be due to the addition of a fixed slowing of the eyes whenever the target image disappears from the foveal region. When saccades were delayed by step-ramp stimuli, eye accelerations increased markedly approximately 200 ms after stimulus onset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Clark:1999kx,
	abstract = {The last ten years have seen an increasing interest, within cognitive science, in issues concerning the physical body, the local environment, and the complex interplay between neural systems and the wider world in which they function. Yet many unanswered questions remain, and the shape of a genuinely physically embodied, environmentally embedded science of the mind is still unclear. In this article I will raise a number of critical questions concerning the nature and scope of this approach, drawing a distinction between two kinds of appeal to embodiment: (1) 'Simple' cases, in which bodily and environmental properties merely constrain accounts that retain the focus on inner organization and processing; and (2) More radical appeals, in which attention to bodily and environmental features is meant to transform both the subject matter and the theoretical framework of cognitive science.},

Phase I (2010 excavation season) of the project was mainly oriented to test different technologies during the excavation (time of flight and optical laser scanners). In phase II (2011 excavation season) the UC Merced team initiated the excavation of a Neolithic house (building 89), recording all the layers by time phase-shift scanners and computer vision techniques. The recording of the excavation process through the use of digital technologies gave the team the ability to generate 3D models of layers and micro-stratigraphies in stereovision during the excavation (using stereo projectors), so as to stimulate a new digital hermeneutics in archaeology. At the end of the fieldwork all the 3D models are accessible through a Teleimmersive system created by UC Merced and UC Berkeley.},

Human-Computer Interaction spans many disciplines, from the social and behavioral sciences to information and computer technology. But of all the textbooks on HCI technology and applications, none has adequately addressed HCI's multidisciplinary foundationsuntil now. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks fills a huge void in the education and training of advanced HCI students. Its authors comprise a veritable house of diamondsinternationally known HCI researchers, every one of whom has successfully applied a unique scientific method to solve practical problems. Each chapter focuses on a different scientific analysis or approach, but all in an identical format, especially designed to facilitate comparison of the various models. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks answers the question raised by the other HCI textbooks: How can HCI theory can support practice in HCI? * Traces HCI research from its origins * Surveys 14 different successful research approaches in HCI * Presents each approach in a common format to facilitate comparisons * Web-enhanced with teaching tools at http://www.HCImodels.com *Contributors are leading researchers in the field of Human-Comptuter Interaction *Fills a major gap in current literature about the rich scientific foundations of HCI *Provides a thorough pedogological survey of the science of HCI},

	abstract = {We compared the precision of perceptual localization and manual pointing. A Gaussian blob was presented 6\,\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} to the right or left of a central fixation spot on a CRT screen. Above and below the blob, vertical lines were displayed. On each trial, the blob was slightly offset to the right or left with respect to the lines. The subjects had to judge whether the blob appeared to the right or to the left of the vertical lines. At the same time, they had to point to the center of the blob with their index finger. Precision for perceived position was significantly better than precision for pointing. Performance in these two tasks correlated highly between the subjects. Overall, subjects pointed more leftward on trials where they judged the blob to be to the left of the lines. There was also a significant correlation for each subject between the pointing error and the perceived location error, calculated by partialling out the effect of the physical offset. The results are in agreement with the idea that the signals determining the perceived location of an object are used to guide the motor system in pointing toward it.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is a powerful tool for investigating user experience in interactive systems by simulating experiences that are challenging to obtain in real life. However, it is crucial to design VR tasks appropriately, especially when used for training first responders who face high cognitive workloads in extreme conditions. Poorly designed VR tasks can strain cognitive resources and hinder human performance and training transfer. Therefore, careful attention must be given to developing VR tasks that enhance cognitive processing in high-cognitive workload scenarios. This study aims to assess the impact of different types and intensities of alerts on reaction time and comprehension of notifications, and task performance in a VR environment designed to induce various levels of cognitive load. Two experiments were conducted, including a remote experiment, where participants had to complete a task in which they identified matching figures while reacting to and interpreting alerts delivered through auditory, visual, and haptic channels. Results showed that, while task performance was not affected by alert type or intensity, audio alerts were the slowest to react to, indicating higher cognitive processing in alerts of that modality.},

@article{Guiard:1987,
	abstract = {This article presents a tentative theoretical framework for the study of asymmetry in the context of human bimanual action. It is emphasized that in humans most skilled manual activities involve two hands playing different roles, a fact that has been often overlooked in the experimental study of human manual lateralization. As an alternative to the current concepts of manual preference and manual superiority, whose relevance is limited to the particular case of unimanual actions, the more general concept of lateral preference is proposed, to denote preference for one of the two possible ways of assigning two roles to two hands. A simple model describing intermanual division of labor in the variety of human skilled manual activities is outlined. The two main assumptions of the model are the following. 1) The two hands represent two motors, that is, devices serving to create motion, whose internal (biomechanical and physiological) complexity is ignored in the suggested approach. 2) In humans, the two manual motors cooperate with one another as if they were assembled in series, thereby forming a kinematic chain: In right-handers allowed to follow their lateral preferences, motion produced by the right hand tends to articulate with motion produced by the left. It is suggested that the kinematic chain model may help in understanding the adaptive advantage of human manual specialization.},

@article{Ifft06112013,
	abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are artificial systems that aim to restore sensation and movement to paralyzed patients. So far, BMIs have enabled only one arm to be moved at a time. Control of bimanual arm movements remains a major challenge. We have developed and tested a bimanual BMI that enables rhesus monkeys to control two avatar arms simultaneously. The bimanual BMI was based on the extracellular activity of 374 to 497 neurons recorded from several frontal and parietal cortical areas of both cerebral hemispheres. Cortical activity was transformed into movements of the two arms with a decoding algorithm called a fifth-order unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The UKF was trained either during a manual task performed with two joysticks or by having the monkeys passively observe the movements of avatar arms. Most cortical neurons changed their modulation patterns when both arms were engaged simultaneously. Representing the two arms jointly in a single UKF decoder resulted in improved decoding performance compared with using separate decoders for each arm. As the animals' performance in bimanual BMI control improved over time, we observed widespread plasticity in frontal and parietal cortical areas. Neuronal representation of the avatar and reach targets was enhanced with learning, whereas pairwise correlations between neurons initially increased and then decreased. These results suggest that cortical networks may assimilate the two avatar arms through BMI control. These findings should help in the design of more sophisticated BMIs capable of enabling bimanual motor control in human patients.},

	abstract = {Finallya thorough pedagogical survey of the multidisciplinary science of HCI. Human-Computer Interaction spans many disciplines, from the social and behavioral sciences to information and computer technology. But of all the textbooks on HCI technology and applications, none has adequately addressed HCI's multidisciplinary foundationsuntil now. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks fills a huge void in the education and training of advanced HCI students. Its authors comprise a veritable house of diamondsinternationally known HCI researchers, every one of whom has successfully applied a unique scientific method to solve practical problems. Each chapter focuses on a different scientific analysis or approach, but all in an identical format, especially designed to facilitate comparison of the various models. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks answers the question raised by the other HCI textbooks: How can HCI theory can support practice in HCI? * Traces HCI research from its origins * Surveys 14 different successful research approaches in HCI * Presents each approach in a common format to facilitate comparisons * Web-enhanced with teaching tools at http://www.HCImodels.com *Contributors are leading researchers in the field of Human-Comptuter Interaction *Fills a major gap in current literature about the rich scientific foundations of HCI *Provides a thorough pedogological survey of the science of HCI},

	abstract = {Conditions that give rise to phase shifts among the limbs when an animal changes gait are poorly understood. Often a {\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\'u}switch mechanism{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\`u} is invoked that has a neural basis which remains speculative. Abrupt phase transitions also occur between the two hands in humans when movement-cycling frequency is continuously increased. The asymmetrical out-of-phase mode shifts suddenly to a symmetrical in-phase mode involving simultaneous activation of homologous muscle groups. The boundary between the two coordinative states is indexed by a dimensionless critical number, which remains constant regardless of whether the hands move freely or are subject to resistive loading. Coordinated shifts appear to arise because of continuous scaling influences that render the existing mode unstable. Then, at a critical point, bifurcation occurs and a new stable (and perhaps energetically more efficient) mode emerges.},

They now present studies comparing the behavior of upper and lower extremity NMCC measures in different populations to the behavior expected for a measure of coordination determined by a survey of experienced therapists. Results provide additional support for the NMCC concept as a means to standardize coordination measurement.

@article{Miall:1996fk,
	abstract = {We confirm Craik's (1947) observation that the human manually tracking a visual target behaves like an intermittent servo-controller. Such tracking responses are indicative of ``sampled'' negative-feedback control but could be the result of other, continuous, mechanisms. Tracking performance therefore was recorded in a task in which visual feedback of the position of the hand-held joystick could be eliminated. Depriving the subjects of visual feedback led to smoother tracking and greatly reduced the signal power of their responses between 0.5-1.8 Hz. Their responses remained intermittent when they used feedback of their own position but not of the target to track a remembered (virtual) target. Hence, intermittency in tracking behavior is not exclusively a signature of visual feedback control but also may be a sign of feedback to memorized waveforms. Craik's (1947) suggestion that the intermittency is due to a refractory period following each movement was also tested. The errors measured at the start of each intermittent response, during tracking of slow waveforms, showed evidence of a small error deadzone (measuring 0.7 cm on the VDU screen or 0.8\,\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} at the eye). At higher target speeds, however, the mean size of starting errors increased, and the upper boundary of the distribution of starting errors was close to that expected of a refractory delay of approximately 170 ms between responses. We consider a model of the control system that can fit these results by incorporating an error deadzone within a feedback control loop. We therefore propose that the initiation of intermittent tracking responses may be limited by a positional error deadzone and that evidence for a refractory period between successive corrective movements can be satisfied without evoking an explicit timing or sampling mechanism.},

@misc{Miller:1956uq,
	abstract = {First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.},

	abstract = {Radiologists are trained professionals who use medical images to obtain clinically relevant information. However, little is known about visual search patterns and strategies radiologists employ during medical image analysis. Thus, there is a current need for guidelines to specify optimal visual search routines commonly used by radiologists. Identifying these features could improve radiologist training and assist radiologists in their work. Our study found that during the moments in which radiologists view chest X-ray images in silence before verbalizing the analysis, they exhibit unique search patterns regardless of the type of disease depicted. Our findings suggest that radiologists' search behaviors can be identified at this stage. However, when radiologists verbally interpret the X-rays, the gaze patterns appear noisy and arbitrary. Current deep-learning approaches train their systems using this noisy and arbitrary gaze data. This may explain why previous research still needs to show the superiority of deep-learning models that use eye tracking for disease classification. Our paper investigates these patterns and attempts to uncover the eye-gaze configurations during the different analysis phases.},

	abstract = {Finallya thorough pedagogical survey of the multidisciplinary science of HCI. Human-Computer Interaction spans many disciplines, from the social and behavioral sciences to information and computer technology. But of all the textbooks on HCI technology and applications, none has adequately addressed HCI's multidisciplinary foundationsuntil now. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks fills a huge void in the education and training of advanced HCI students. Its authors comprise a veritable house of diamondsinternationally known HCI researchers, every one of whom has successfully applied a unique scientific method to solve practical problems. Each chapter focuses on a different scientific analysis or approach, but all in an identical format, especially designed to facilitate comparison of the various models. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks answers the question raised by the other HCI textbooks: How can HCI theory can support practice in HCI? * Traces HCI research from its origins * Surveys 14 different successful research approaches in HCI * Presents each approach in a common format to facilitate comparisons * Web-enhanced with teaching tools at http://www.HCImodels.com *Contributors are leading researchers in the field of Human-Comptuter Interaction *Fills a major gap in current literature about the rich scientific foundations of HCI *Provides a thorough pedogological survey of the science of HCI},

@article{Olk:2018aa,
	abstract = {An important issue of psychological research is how experiments conducted in the laboratory or theories based on such experiments relate to human performance in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) allows control over stimuli and conditions at increased ecological validity. The goal of the present study was to accomplish a transfer of traditional paradigms that assess attention and distraction to immersive VR. To further increase ecological validity we explored attentional effects with daily objects as stimuli instead of simple letters. Participants searched for a target among distractors on the countertop of a virtual kitchen. Target--distractor discriminability was varied and the displays were accompanied by a peripheral flanker that was congruent or incongruent to the target. Reaction time was slower when target--distractor discriminability was low and when flankers were incongruent. The results were replicated in a second experiment in which stimuli were presented on a computer screen in two dimensions. The study demonstrates the successful translation of traditional paradigms and manipulations into immersive VR and lays a foundation for future research on attention and distraction in VR. Further, we provide an outline for future studies that should use features of VR that are not available in traditional laboratory research.},

@article{Prablanc:1979si,
	abstract = {In a task requiring an optimal hand pointing (with regards to both time and accuracy) at a peripheral target, there is first a saccade of the eye within 250 ms, followed 100 ms later by the hand movement. However, the latency of the hand movement is poorly correlated with that of the eye movement. When the peripheral target is cut off at the onset of the saccade, there is no correlation between the error of the gaze position and the error of the hand pointing. This suggests an early parallel processing of the two motor outputs. The duration of hand movement does not change significantly when subjects either see or not see their hand (closed or open loop). In the open loop situation, the undershoot of the hand pointing increases with target eccentricity, whatever the subjects are allowed or not to do a saccade toward the target. It suggests that the encoding of eye position by itself is a poor index for an accurately guided movement of the hand},

Leveraging novel technical capabilities of an immersive virtual environment, we probed the component kinematic processes that mediate sensorimotor learning. Twenty na{\"{\i}}ve subjects performed a simulated marksmanship task modeled after Olympic Trap Shooting standards. We measured movement kinematics and shooting performance as participants practiced 350 trials while receiving trial-by-trial feedback about shooting success. Spatiotemporal analysis of motion tracking elucidated the ballistic and refinement phases of hand movements. We found systematic changes in movement kinematics that accompanied improvements in shot accuracy during training, though reaction and response times did not change over blocks. In particular, we observed longer, slower, and more precise ballistic movements that replaced effort spent on corrections and refinement. Collectively, these results leverage developments in immersive virtual reality technology to quantify and compare the kinematics of movement during early learning of full-body sensorimotor orienting.},

The results show different patterns in the four hand-field combinations. The following conclusion can be drawn from the results of the delayed condition. In the case of patient O. K., the delay reduced the pointing variability for both hands in the left visual field but not in the right visual field. However, the pointing biases did not improve accordingly.

@article{Sainburg:1993vn,
	abstract = {1. We analyzed the performance of a simple pantomimed gesture in 2 patients with large-fiber sensory neuropathy and 11 control subjects to determine how proprioceptive deafferentation disrupts unconstrained multijoint movements. Both patients had near-total loss of joint position, vibration, and discriminative touch sensation in the upper extremities. Muscle strength remained intact. 2. Subjects performed a gesture similar to slicing a loaf of bread. In this gesture, the hand first moves outward from the body, reverses direction sharply, and then moves back toward the body. Accurate performance requires precise coordination between the shoulder and elbow joints during movement reversals. Movements were performed under two conditions: with eyes open and with eyes closed. Three dimensional shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand trajectories were recorded on a WATSMART system. 3. When control subjects performed the gesture with their eyes closed, their wrist trajectories were relatively straight and individual cycles of motion were planar. Movements reversed direction sharply, such that outward and inward portions of the wrist path were closely aligned. Corresponding to this spatial profile, the reversals in movement direction at the shoulder joint, from flexion to extension, and at the elbow joint, from extension to flexion, were synchronous. 4. In contrast, when deafferented patients performed the gesture with their eyes closed, their wrist trajectories were highly curved and individual cycles were severely nonplanar. The wrist paths showed a characteristic anomaly during the reversal in movement direction, when elbow joint movement became transiently locked. Correspondingly, the movement reversals at the shoulder and elbow joints were severely temporally decoupled. 5. When patients were able to view their limbs during performance of this gesture there was significant improvement in the linearity and planarity of movements. However, the patients remained unable to synchronize the movements at the shoulder and elbow joints to produce spatially precise wrist paths. 6. We conclude that loss of proprioception disrupts interjoint coordination and discuss the hypothesis that this interjoint coordination deficit results from a failure to control the interaction forces that arise between limb segments during multijoint movements.},

Human-Computer Interaction spans many disciplines, from the social and behavioral sciences to information and computer technology. But of all the textbooks on HCI technology and applications, none has adequately addressed HCI's multidisciplinary foundationsuntil now. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks fills a huge void in the education and training of advanced HCI students. Its authors comprise a veritable house of diamondsinternationally known HCI researchers, every one of whom has successfully applied a unique scientific method to solve practical problems. Each chapter focuses on a different scientific analysis or approach, but all in an identical format, especially designed to facilitate comparison of the various models. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks answers the question raised by the other HCI textbooks: How can HCI theory can support practice in HCI? * Traces HCI research from its origins * Surveys 14 different successful research approaches in HCI * Presents each approach in a common format to facilitate comparisons * Web-enhanced with teaching tools at http://www.HCImodels.com *Contributors are leading researchers in the field of Human-Comptuter Interaction *Fills a major gap in current literature about the rich scientific foundations of HCI *Provides a thorough pedogological survey of the science of HCI},

New hardware features that are currently finding their way into state-of-the-art phones-such as digital compasses and tilt sensors-promise to drive the adoption of mobile geospatial services, and to change the way people navigate, explore and interact with their physical environment: location-based applications that exploit attitude information to realise orientation-aware interaction have been discussed in research for several years. Yet, few actual results on the achievable real-world performance of such systems exist in literature. In this article, we report on a series of function trials carried out with a prototype Geo-Wand-a portable system that allows users to access geo-referenced information by physically pointing towards objects in the real world. The application was realised with a mass market mobi},

@article{Stuart:2022uc,
	abstract = {Introduction: Virtual humans have expanded the training opportunities available to healthcare learners. Particularly, virtual humans have allowed simulation to display visual cues that were not previously possible in other forms of healthcare training. However, the effect of virtual human fidelity on the perception of visual cues is unclear. Therefore, we explore the effect of virtual human rendering style on the perceptions of visual cues in a healthcare context.Methods: To explore the effect of rendering style on visual cues, we created a virtual human interface that allows users to interact with virtual humans that feature different rendering styles. We performed a mixed design user study that had undergraduate healthcare students (n = 107) interact with a virtual patient. The interaction featured a patient experiencing an allergic reaction and required trainees to identify visual cues (patient symptoms). The rendering styles explored include a 3D modeled virtual human and an AI generated photorealistic virtual human. Visual cues were applied using a Snapchat Lens.Results: When users are given a frame of reference (users could directly compare symptoms on both rendering styles), they rated the realism and severity of the photorealistic virtual human's symptoms significantly higher than the realism of the 3D virtual human's symptoms. However, we were unable to find significant differences in symptom realism and severity ratings when users were not given a frame of reference (users only interacted with one style of virtual humans). Additionally, we were unable to find significant differences in user interpersonal communication behaviors between the 3D and photorealistic rendering styles.Conclusion: Our findings suggest 1) higher fidelity rendering styles may be preferred if the learning objectives of a simulation require observing subtle visual cues on virtual humans and 2) the realism of virtual human rendering style does not necessarily affect participants' interpersonal communication behaviors (time spent, questions asked).},

	abstract = {Selection by progressive refinement allows the accurate acquisition of targets with small visual sizes while keeping the required precision of the task low. Using the eyes as a means to perform 3D selections is naturally hindered by the low accuracy of eye movements. To account for this low accuracy, we propose to use the concept of progressive refinement to allow accurate 3D selection. We designed a novel eye tracking selection technique with progressive refinement--Eye-controlled Sphere-casting refined by QUAD-menu (EyeSQUAD). We propose an approximation method to stabilize the calculated point-of-regard and a space partitioning method to improve computation. We evaluated the performance of EyeSQUAD in comparison to two previous selection techniques--ray-casting and SQUAD--under different target size and distractor density conditions. Results show that EyeSQUAD outperforms previous eye tracking-based selection techniques, is more accurate and can achieve similar selection speed as ray-casting, and is less accurate and slower than SQUAD. We discuss implications of designing eye tracking-based progressive refinement interaction techniques and provide a potential solution for multimodal user interfaces with eye tracking.},

Human-Computer Interaction spans many disciplines, from the social and behavioral sciences to information and computer technology. But of all the textbooks on HCI technology and applications, none has adequately addressed HCI's multidisciplinary foundationsuntil now. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks fills a huge void in the education and training of advanced HCI students. Its authors comprise a veritable house of diamondsinternationally known HCI researchers, every one of whom has successfully applied a unique scientific method to solve practical problems. Each chapter focuses on a different scientific analysis or approach, but all in an identical format, especially designed to facilitate comparison of the various models. HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks answers the question raised by the other HCI textbooks: How can HCI theory can support practice in HCI? * Traces HCI research from its origins * Surveys 14 different successful research approaches in HCI * Presents each approach in a common format to facilitate comparisons * Web-enhanced with teaching tools at http://www.HCImodels.com *Contributors are leading researchers in the field of Human-Comptuter Interaction *Fills a major gap in current literature about the rich scientific foundations of HCI *Provides a thorough pedogological survey of the science of HCI},

Three bimanual finger combinations, in random order (2 index; 2 middle; and 1 index and 1 middle), were performed in in-phase and antiphase coordination modes, in addition to 1 unimanual combination (antiphase index-middle). Relative phase means were within 3in all antiphase vs. in-phase conditions, accompanied by lower phasing variability and lower intrafinger consistency in the antiphase. When frequency was changed from the preferred rate, the 2 coordination modes became more alike in variability and, within the same frequency range, demonstrated no significant differences. The bimanual mixed-fingers tapping tended to have significantly lower phasing values (a small fixed point drift) and higher tapping frequencies than the symmetric conditions. The unimanual task wa},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess differences in fatigue-related changes in variables related to structures within the neuromuscular system, between the dominant and non-dominant elbow flexor muscles of right-handed individuals. Two experimental sessions were performed on the right arm and one on the left arm. For each session, maximum voluntary torque, level of voluntary activation, M-wave amplitude, twitch/train or twitch/doublet torque ratio and EMG median frequency were obtained before and up to 20 min after a sustained maximum isometric fatigue task. Our main results were: 1) reproducible fatigue-induced changes in all variables of interest between the two sessions performed with the right arm, 2) significantly greater failure in voluntary activation and neuromuscular propagation with sustained activity for the non-dominant compared with dominant side, and 3) no effect of dominance on MVC torque, endurance time, and fatigue-induced changes in EMG median frequency and elicited torques. These results suggest that the preferential use of elbow flexor muscles with the dominant arm leads to more fatigue resistance in certain structures/mechanisms of the neuromuscular system, but not in others.},
